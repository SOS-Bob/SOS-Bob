Hi, Iâ€™m Bob(Steam) aka Peacebob(Discord, Arma). Here @SOS-Bob.
I have some knowledge of sqf-language and I have been designing MERCS Arma addon, in which I have added and altered scripts made during Arma:s 20y old history by other authors.
My current interest is game peripherals, related to Arma of course. Inspired by the work of Armacom-people. I have pulled through a development of a punch vest. About to open the subject again sooner or later.
