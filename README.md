Hi, Iâ€™m Bob(Steam) aka Peacebob(Discord, Arma). Here @SOS-Bob.
I have some knowledge of sqf-language and I have been designing MERCS Arma addon, in which I have added and altered scripts made during Arma:s 20y old history by other authors.
My current interest is game peripherals, related to Arma of course. Inspired by the work of Armacom-people I have started development of no less than a punch vest.
